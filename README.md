## Customer analysis: Here are some tasks
- Understand the current purchasing trends and behaviours. 
- The client is particularly interested in customer segments and chip purchasing behaviour.

I've shared some insights below so you can check with my code.

## Brand Insight
1. There is a big difference between Total Sales and Total Sold products among some brands (Smiths, Doritos, Thins and Cobs)
=> Those products should be pushed for sales to gain profitability

2. Top 3 favourite brands: Smiths, Doritos and Thins
- There are more product lines in Smiths than other brands
- The big package size of Smiths is preferable (300, 380g) while other sizes are much less sales
- Even though Doritos, Thins and Cobs have fewer product lines, all of the products are well-sold

3. Customers seem not to be sensitive to price because the price of Cobs, Doritos and Thins is higher than other brands with the same package size; the majority of Customers still choose them

4. There is a tendency for older people to buy more chips than younger people. There are 2 hypotheses to explain this trend
- This store is located in the area where the majority is older
The younger generation chooses to live healthier; therefore, they do not spend much on chips.


## Customer insights
- There are more Mainstream - young singles/couples and Mainstream - retirees who buy chips. This contributes to more sales to these customer segments, which is not a major driver for the Budget - Older Families segment.

- Even though the young, new and middle-aged segment do not buy frequently, they are ready to pay more than the older people
    + The Mainstream Young and middle-aged singles/couples and Budget Retirees pay the highest rate for a product
    + New Family is insignificant in the number of sold products, but this segment has the potential to focus on due to their high spending
    + Retirees and Older singles/couples are the main segments driving chip sales and revenue

- To summarize, 
    + Segments we should put more effort into raising their demand: Mainstream Midage and young singles/couples, New Families
    + Segments to retain the number of customers: the older (older families and singles/couples and retirees)
